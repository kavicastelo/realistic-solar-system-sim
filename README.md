## packages & libraries

- pygame
- math

## functions

- draw()
    - this function makes the mainframe and helps to set each element's position of the screen. also this makes what are
      the actual distances from planets to the sun.

- attraction()
    - this function calculates how to force each planet gravity with other planets. means, venus need more force to
      circulation because mercury gravity in addition sun's gravity.

- update_position()
    - this function calculates position changing all planets according to timestamp and updates the screen at 60fps.
      timestamp calculates 1ms equals 1 day in the real world
